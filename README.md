# Pick-A-Piano

This repository is a sample project.

It creates allows a user to create unlimited pianos, and remove them.

Pianos created have 7 keys, that each corresponds to a musical chord.

Multiple piano capability coming soon!

Currently the only Piano that is creatable, is a Piano key necktie.

Input passed to each piano's input field, must be in the format similar too:
'a,b,c' OR 'A,B,C'

If an incorrect letter is passed(i.e. one that isn't a chord) or formatting is incorrect, an alert will be dispatched.
